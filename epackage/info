Description: client for Jabber XMPP protocol
 .
 A Jabber identifier (JID) is of the form username@server, just like an
 e-mail address, and every Jabber user whose server is open to Internet
 connections can communicate with any other user. Note that the Google Talk
 service is an XMPP service, so if you have a GMail account, you already
 have a JID ending with @gmail.com. Connections ports needed are 5222 and
 5223 for ssl.
 .
 To use, configure jabber-username, jabber-server, jabber-network-server,
 jabber-connection-type and call M-x jabber-connect (C-u C-x C-j C-c). To
 disconnect, type M-x jabber-disconnect (C-x C-j C-d). See all commands
 with C-x C-j C-h.
 .
 For encrypted connections, like Google Tak, GnuTLS or OpenSSL is
 required.
 .
 NOTE: Marked unsafe because defines unconditionally keys to global
 keymap; keys cannot be relocated to another prefix than C-x.
